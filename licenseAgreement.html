    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Governing Law and Forum Selection.</u>  The validity of this License and the rights, obligations and relations of the parties shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America, without giving effect to the principles of conflict or choice of law of such Commonwealth.  You acknowledge that any action or suit brought to enforce any right or remedy of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of federal and state courts in Virginia.  The original of this License has been written in English.  The parties hereto waive any statute, law, or regulation that might provide an alternative law or forum or to have this Agreement written in any language other than English.  Skyline and you exclude the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods from this License.

        <u>U.S. Government Restricted Rights.   The Software and any accompanying manuals are "commercial items" (as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101) that were developed at private expense, are not in the public domain, and are provided to any agency, contractor or subcontractor of the U.S. Government (at any tier) subject to the maximum restrictions on use permitted by FAR 52.227-19 for civilian agencies and DFARS 227.7202-3(a) (Jan. 1, 2000) for military agencies, or successor regulations. Thus, to the maximum extent permitted by law the U.S. Government and any intermediate buyers obtain only those rights specified herein. Contractor/manufacturer Skyline Software Systems, Inc., 13873 Park Center Road, Suite 201, Herndon, Virginia, U.S.A..</u>
    </p>            
    <p>
    <u>Export Controls.</u>  In accordance with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Export Administration Regulations (EAR): “These commodities, technology or software were exported from the United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion contrary to U.S. law is prohibited.”
    </p>    
    <p>
    None of the Software or underlying information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or reexported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U. S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders.  By downloading or using the Software, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.  In addition, you are responsible for complying with any local laws in your jurisdiction which may affect your right to import, export or use the Software, and represent that you have complied with any regulations or registration procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable.

    <p>
    For TerraExplorer products that contain the C2MP Extension, US ITAR regulations require the following disclosure: "
    </p>
    <p>
    These commodities are authorized by the U.S. Government for export only to [country of ultimate destination] for use by [end-user]. They may not be transferred, transshipped on a non-continuous voyage, or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their original form or after being incorporated into other end-items, without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State.”
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>Miscellaneous.</u>  You may not assign or transfer in any way this License, any rights or obligations thereto, the Software or any modifications thereto without the prior written consent of Skyline.  If any provision of this License is held to be excessively broad as to scope, activity, subject or otherwise so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision shall be constructed by limiting or reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.  This License represents the entire understanding between the parties with respect to its subject matter and merges all prior written and oral communications.  This License may not be modified except by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of both parties.  A waiver by either party of its rights hereunder shall not be binding unless contained in a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of the party waiving its rights.  The non-enforcement or waiver of any provision on one occasion shall not constitute a waiver of such provision on any other occasions unless expressly so agreed in writing.
